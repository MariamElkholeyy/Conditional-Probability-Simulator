# Conditional Probability Simulator

This Python-based simulator provides a user-friendly interface to explore and calculate conditional probabilities. It allows you to define events, their probabilities, and calculate the conditional probability of one event given another.









## Features

- Event Definition: Add events with their respective probabilities.
- Conditional Probability Calculation: Calculate the conditional probability of one event given another.
- Simulation: Simulate conditional probability using Monte Carlo methods.
- Visualization: Visualize event probabilities and conditional probability using Matplotlib.






## Example

Enter the number of events: 3
Enter event 1 name: Event A
Enter event 1 probability (0-1): 0.4
Enter event 2 name: Event B
Enter event 2 probability (0-1): 0.6
Enter event 3 name: Event C
Enter event 3 probability (0-1): 0.3
